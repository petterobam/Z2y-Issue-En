As a programmer myself, I may not cater to all users' aesthetic preferences, so I need you all to provide more information and suggestions, including but not limited to:

1. Suggestions for adjusting page styles
2. Suggestions for adjusting product features
3. Suggestions for adding new product features
4. Suggestions for designing feature workflows
5. Suggestions for adjustments in other directions

Of course, since the code is designed holistically from top to bottom, if there are highly personalized adjustments in the future, I will develop interfaces or plugin modes, providing practical examples for you to customize styles or workflows on your own. For example, skins, layouts, etc., can all be adjusted openly. Currently, I don't have enough time to extract and write documentation, so please feel free to submit and record your suggestions in advance.
